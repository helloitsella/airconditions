            <p>Air Conditions is an open ended gathering of people who annually grant their attention and sensitivity towards Air. </p>
            Air as companion, Air as subject, substance, discourse, ecology. <br>
            - seeking formats and constellations in a variety of scales to attempt to let Air question, examine and infiltrate our practices and communities and bend our thoughts and bodies through and towards this lens of Air.
