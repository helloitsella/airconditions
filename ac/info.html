        <p> Air Conditions is an open ended gathering of people who annually grant their attention and sensitivity towards Air. 
        </p>
Air as companion, Air as subject,  substance, discourse, ecology.<br>
<p>We seek formats and constellations in a variety of scales to attempt to let Air question, examine and infiltrate our practices and communities and bend our thoughts and bodies through the lens of Air.
</p>
<p>In 2021 from the 3rd - 7th of November Air Conditions will take the form of a radio conference. </p>
<p>Through a series of radio broadcasts from Seydisfjordur Community Radio we will be giving our attention to Air and its current conditions with ten commissioned works adapted for radio by collaborators from various fields.
</p>

You can take part by tuning in on:<br>
FM 107.1 in Seydisfjordur, Iceland<br>
