    <p>In 2021 Air Conditions took form as a radio conference composed and cared for by a group of collaborators representing varieties of practices and mediums.</p>

    <p>Through a series of radio broadcasts from Seydisfjordur Community Radio we gave attention to Air and its current conditions with contributions in forms of sound, choir, composition, music, writing, drama, coding, talks, interviews and readings - adapted for radio </p>
    
    <p>The conference unfolded over five days of live radio from the 3rd - 7th of November in Seydisfjordur, Iceland</p>
